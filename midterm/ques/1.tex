\begin{itemize}
		\item Increase the size of block: 
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Currently, the size of block is fixed, hence at max only a couple of thousand transactions can be included in a block. 
			\item Con: Larger blocks makes lesser number of miners/hashers to run as full nodes, hence causing the power to be centralized into some handful of pools. More data per block = more data to process for each node. This inevitably causes decentralization, and hence lowers the trust in bitcoin.
	\end{itemize}
		\item Decrease the difficulty to mine a block. 
	\begin{itemize}
			\item This causes more number of blocks to be mined per hour, and hence increases the number of transactions.
			\item Con: More number of forks may occur due to lower time to mine a block. It wastes hashing power and electricity too.
	\end{itemize}
