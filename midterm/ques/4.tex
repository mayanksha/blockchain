\section{Selfish Mining}

\subsection{}
A selfish miner doesn't gets benefitted directly by mining selfishly, Instead, what he relies upon is wasting the hash/compute power of other miners to effectively gain advantage over them. \\ \\
By broadcasting a block sometime later, he makes the other miners mine for the same block which has been found out by him. So, while he's trying to find a newer block, the others are just wasting their efforts on the previous block, thereby getting an unfair advantage over others.
\subsection{}
Firstly, a globally synchronizable time is not achievable. Secondly, The miner who is mining the block is the master of the block at that time, so he can decide to forge a fake time on the new block. This will further cause problems with the blockchain.
