\section{Mining Pools}
The designer can change the hash puzzle problem from "Find the nonce such that the Hash belongs to the target space " to the new hash puzzle "Find the nonce and such that the hash of the digital signature belongs to a certain target space".  \\  \\
This setting automatically highly discourages a minig pool setup because calculating the digital signature requires the knowledge of private key of pool manager to all the nodes participating in the pool. 
\\ \\
Any malicious person can steal the private key and use this to steal the money from the bitcoin wallet to which a block reward payment goes to on successful mining of a block. This way, a mining pool get split into a few trusted nodes only.
