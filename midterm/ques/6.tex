\section{BoyCott possible?}

Bitcoin has no mechanism to penalize any malicious user, thereby a scheme wherein we BoyCott some node is not possible. Even if such a scheme were possible, the malicious person can simply create a new wallet address by generating a new public/private key pair and using that to mine blocks.
Blockchain also doesn't store any information related to the IP of miners hence an IP ban is out of the way too. Hence, boycotting any miner's chain can't prevent them from creating a new identity (priv/pub key pair) and start performing malicious behaviour again. \\ \\ 
Instead, what blockchain relies upon for promoting normal behaviour is the game-theoretic possibilities which a node can use to maximize his profits. Each node picks a strategy  to maximize its payoff by taking into account the other nodes' potential strategies. Every node is assumed to act according to its incentives, we can't split nodes into malicious or benign.
