The statement \ti{ “In bitcoin blockchain, double-spend attack is never possible” } is false. Double-spending attacks however uncommon can be possible due to the following two reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item For the merchants accepting 0-confimation transactions, a double-spending is highly probable (called race attack). The person (say Alice) paying to the merchant for a service can send a valid transaction to merchant while also sending a conflicting transaction spending the coin to himself to the rest of network. \\ \\
		Then, any malicious node (which can be controlled by Alice) can cause the correct transaction to not be included in the new block, whereas a double-spending transaction will get processed and be included in the next block by such a node.
		\item \bo{51 \% attack: } A single large enough node which controls 51\% hash rate of the network can cause his own privately mined fork to grow to a large extent and then publishing his own mined blocks to the main chain.
			Moreover, since such an entity has large hashing power, he can mine blocks at a much faster rate thereby confirming the double-spending transactions faster than any heahtly node can. The moment of relief is that such an attack is highly improbable.  
\end{itemize}
